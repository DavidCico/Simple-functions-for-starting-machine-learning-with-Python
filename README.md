# Simple-functions-for-starting-machine-learning-with-Python
The current repository contains different functions implemented in Python from scratch, to understand the basic steps to carry out a machine learning problem.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need Python 3.x to run the following code.  You can have multiple Python versions (2.x and 3.x) installed on the same system without problems.

In Ubuntu, Mint and Debian you can install Python 3 like this:

    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
    
For other Linux flavors, OS X and Windows, python is availabe at http://www.python.org/getit/.  


## File descriptions

* 'Open_conversion_data.ipynb' is the first Jupyter notebook of the series, which treats of the initial operations to be done to read the data from a CSV file, modify the variable types in the different columns (features) of the dataset, as well as data re-scaling, such as normalization and standardization.

### Running the program

The code is ready to be used and just requires running the following command:

    python Main.py
