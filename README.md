# Simple-functions-for-starting-machine-learning-with-Python
The current repository contains different functions implemented in Python from scratch, to understand the basic steps to carry out a machine learning problem.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need Python 3.x to run the following code.  You can have multiple Python versions (2.x and 3.x) installed on the same system without problems.

In Ubuntu, Mint and Debian you can install Python 3 like this:

    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
    
For other Linux flavors, OS X and Windows, python is availabe at http://www.python.org/getit/.  


## File descriptions

* 'Open_conversion_data.ipynb' is the first Jupyter notebook of the series, which treats of the initial operations to be done to read the data from a CSV file, modify the variable types in the different columns (features) of the dataset, as well as data re-scaling, such as normalization and standardization.

### Running the files

The notebooks can be **directly opened on GitHub**. An alternative way to open the notebooks, is to run the Jupyter Notebook. This can be done by executing the following command at the Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows):

    jupyter notebook

This will print some information about the notebook server in your terminal, including the URL of the web application (by default, http://localhost:8888):

    $ jupyter notebook
    [I 08:58:24.417 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /Users/catherine
    [I 08:58:24.417 NotebookApp] 0 active kernels
    [I 08:58:24.417 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at: http://localhost:8888/
    [I 08:58:24.417 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).

It will then open your default web browser to this URL.

When the notebook opens in your browser, you will see the Notebook Dashboard, which will show a list of the notebooks, files, and subdirectories in the directory where the notebook server was started. The notebook can then be chosen by navigating in the Notebook Dashboard.
