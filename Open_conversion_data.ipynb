    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">When it comes to analyzing data, feature scaling through normalization or standardization can be an important pre-processing step for many machine learning algorithms. While many algorithms require features to be normalized, intuitively we can think of <a href =\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis\">Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</a> as being a prime example of when normalization is important. PCA is a technique used for identification of a smaller number of uncorrelated variables known as principal components from a larger set of data. Indeed, when a set of data possess many features, it is important to reduce that number of features for training the models in a more efficient way. Also, data normalization makes sense when the features of a dataset are of different genders and units. \n",

    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">As specified above, it can be interesting to normalize the features of the dataset, not only because it is required for some machine learning algorithms, but also as a way to put all data on the same scale. The first way to re-scale the data is to use the <b>Min-Max scaling</b> or more simply called \"Normalization\". That's usually the way we think, when talking about normalization of a dataset. It is the simplest method and consists in rescaling the range of features to scale the range in [0, 1] or [−1, 1]. Selecting the target range depends on the nature of the data. The general formula is given as</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">From a coding point of view, it is first necessary to find the minimum and maximum of each feature (column) of the dataset, with the function <i>dataset_minmax()</i>. To do so a list variable 'minmax' is initialized, then a loop is implemented on all columns of the dataset, with the values of a column once at a time stored in the variable 'colvalues'. The minimum and maximum of 'colvalues' can then be found before adding them to the 'minmax' list and continuing the iterative loop. Finally, the 'minmax' list contains the minimum and maximum values of each column of the dataset, as this is necessary for the normalization procedure. The dataset can then be normalized by looping equation (1) over all values in the function <i>Normalize_Dataset()</i>.</p>"
